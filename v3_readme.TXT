=============
Here are some tips on how the game mechanics work.


===================
THE FOUR ATTRIBUTES
===================
Every attribute, "element", has a strength and a weakness.
Wind (yellow) beats Earth (green), beats Water (blue), beats Fire (red), beats Wind again.
Opposite elements (Wind/Water, Earth/Fire) do about neutral damage to each other,
and each element slightly resists itself.
(Fire attribute takes slightly less Fire damage.)

People have the None attribute ("Man" in vanilla), represented by gray.
They take slightly less damage from all elements, but don't resist or beat any.

Rooks can learn to change attributes using his spirit cards; this effect lasts until
the end of battle. These spells (Barrier of Wind etc; "Change Attr. to Wind" in vanilla)
will make the party deal elemental damage, and take damage as that element.
For instance, changing the party to Wind (yellow) they will deal much higher damage
to Earth (green) enemies and take much lower damage from them, but they'll really
struggle against Fire (red) enemies.


=================
THE STATUS SCREEN
=================
LV-     Your current Experience Level. On a Level Up, all of your stats will improve,
        and you'll naturally learn new spells. Rooks' spirits share his LV,
        as he is able to command them better.
        Also, Level affects your chances of running from battle.
EXP-    Your experience points to reach the next Experience Level.
        As is standard fare nowadays, defeat enemies to gain experience.
HP-     How much damage you can take.
          If any one person runs out of HP, it's GAME OVER.
          If a spirit dies, its card is torn and it must be revived at the Spirit Healer tent.
MP-     How much magic you can use. Spells cost MP, but Rooks can cast some spells with his cards for free.
Str-    Strength; affects your physical damage and boosts your Base Attack.
Endur-  Endurance; affects your physical damage taken and boosts your Base Defense.
Int-    Intelligence; high levels affect magic damage, magic damage taken, and spell accuracy/evasion.
Alert-  Alertness; every 8 points affect your accuracy, evasion, and chance to critical hit.

Equipment window:
This shows your equipped weapon, armor, amulet and ring.
On the right are four stats (up from 2 in vanilla):

Sword-   Base Attack: your weapon plus strength modifier plus attack buff.
Shield-  Base Defense: your armor plus amulet, plus endurance modifier plus defense buff.
Shield*- Magic Defense: determined by your amulet (shields and bracelets).
         (Magic defense is kinda important later.)
x2:      Critical Hit Rate: Your weapon's % chance to strike about double damage.

The other attributes and bonuses are covered in the "Elemental Equipment" and "Enemy Races" sections.


========
DUNGEONS
========
Random encounters are rolled per-step in Arcana. This means, any move or turn
can trigger a fight. The encounter rate was lowered (1/12 -> 1/20) but there's
still a chance to get multiple fights in a row if you're unlucky.
Some extremely rare areas have very high encounter rates (1/4); these can be
used for grinding at best, and an early grave at worst. If you feel unprepared,
there are several options for escaping battle and returning to town.

Every square on the map is a "tile". And event tiles, like treasure chests or
completed boss fights, are no-encounter zones where you can spin with impunity.
This is a great way to heal spirits, who regenerate slowly and can't be healed with items.


===========
BOSS FIGHTS
===========
While exploring dungeons, beware of boss encounters! There are no warnings,
save a feeling that "it must be here, as this is the only way forward".
Bosses are unrunnable encounters, and they're immune to death spells and
all status effects like Sleep. However, they can still be debuffed.


============
STATUS BUFFS
============
The four buffable stats are Attack, Defense, Accuracy and Evasion.
As with everything else, there's one for each of the four elements.
Attack is Fire, Defense is Earth, Accuracy is Water and Evasion is Wind.

There are three states for each buff:
Attack Down    -> Neutral   -> Attack Up
Defense Down   -> Neutral   -> Defense Up
Accuracy Down  -> Neutral   -> Accuracy Up
Evasion Down   -> Neutral   -> Evasion Up

So if your Attack is decreased, you can return it to Neutral with an Attack Up.
And if your Attack is increased, an enemy can return it to Neutral with an Attack Down.

Stat changes last the entire battle, so they're invaluable in long fights.


=======
ENEMIES
=======
Enemies will simply attack at random. If the enemy knows a spell, there's a 50% chance
they'll cast it instead of attacking. Beware that if they're reduced to half health,
this casting chance will increase to 75%. So don't use area-of-effect spells on a
large group of mages unless you're sure it'll kill them.


==============
STATUS EFFECTS
==============
Sleep: The target is unable to act for several turns.
   Physical attacks will NOT wake them.
Confuse: The target swings wildly, targeting a random friend or foe.
   Physical attacks again, won't snap them out of it.
   In Seal of Rimsala, Confuse was buffed so enemies can no longer cast spells.
Paralyze: The target is unable to act... forever. Lasts after battle.
Petrify: Also permanently prevents action and lasts after battle.
   On enemies, this also reduces their HP to 1.
   On allies, they will take 10% max HP damage every turn.

The Spirits aren't targeted by status effects, so they may have to finish the battle sometimes.
Sleep and Confuse are removed after battle, while Paralyze and Petrify can be lifted
with certain items like a Tent; a night at the Inn; or with certain spells.
Incidentally, you can still cast Unpetrify on yourself outside of battle.


===================
ELEMENTAL EQUIPMENT
===================
Some weapons and armor have an attribute, like the Ice Blade.
This can be checked on the Status screen in Seal of Rimsala.

Weapons with an element will ALWAYS DEAL that element, even if you change attributes.
Dangerously, armor with an element will ALWAYS TAKE DAMAGE AS that element, even
if you change attributes. This kind of equipment is niche, and best used if you
know what you'll be fighting.


===========
ENEMY RACES
===========
Some enemies are much tougher, and resist physical attacks.
To beat these, you should hit their weakness with an Anti weapon.
This can also be checked on the Status screen in Seal of Rimsala.

Undead race: Ghosts, zombies and skeletons.
Dragon race: Uh... Dragons.
Medusa race: Enemies with snake hair.
Giant race: Cyclops, Trolls, and Giants.

So if you're fighting lots of undead, get an Anti-Undead weapon for extra damage
and an Anti-Undead amulet to resist them. Mythril is a good bet for that.
If you're fighting lots of giants, try getting your hands on a Morning Star.
