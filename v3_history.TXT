CHANGELOG
=========

v3.0
- Complete script retranslation; a clearer and more descriptive story
    closer in line with the Japanese version. Emphasis was made on clear
    and less-awkward text while keeping the spirit (or patterned spell names).
- Dialogue tricks from JP like variable text speed, a dramatic portrait change,
    and characters don't move their mouths during ellipses.
- The level-up screen now states your new LVL, and the text is right-aligned (prettier).
- An extremely useful, improved dungeon map that shows treasure chests,
    exits, events and where bosses were fought.
- Spell expand patch, shows spell power and accuracy along with room for larger descriptions.
- A buff to the Confuse status (a sucky spell); it now also prevents enemy spellcasting.
- Avoided an annoying trailing-space bug ("Rooks' attribute was changed to Wind .")
- Shop overhaul, now there's more interesting and powerful items to save up gold for.
- Treasure overhaul, money is more plentiful and going out of the way is rewarded.
- Some powerful items are now gated behind bosses so the shop gear isn't immediately obsoleted.
- Added a missing staff member to the credits, a Message Coordinator named Abeshin.
- The documentation has improved to using ASM patches with Asar, and modifying
    or debugging the game is much easier and more modular.
